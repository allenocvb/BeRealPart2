An iOS application that replicates the core functionality of the popular BeReal social media platform, built using Parse and hosted on Back4App. This was created in an iOS 102 class by CodePath. The course helped me gain a deeper understanding of mobile development.

## Description

This BeReal clone is an iOS app that allows users to capture and share moments of their day within a 24-hour window. The app encourages authentic sharing by implementing a unique viewing restriction - users can only see others' posts after uploading their own photo within the given timeframe. It uses Parse as the backend, hosted on Back4App, to handle user authentication, data storage, and retrieval.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and log out. The app supports persistent login across app launches.
- **Photo Capture**: Users can select photos from their device's photo library.
- **Time-Sensitive Sharing**: Posts are only visible to others if the user has shared within the last 24 hours.
- **Location and Time Metadata**: Each post includes timestamp information.
- **Comment Section**: Users can interact with posts through comments, which display usernames.
- **Server-Side Persistence**: Ensures reliable storage and retrieval of photos and post data using Parse and Back4App.

## Technologies Used

- Swift
- UIKit
- Parse Swift SDK
- Back4App (Parse Server host)
- PhotosUI (PHPickerViewController)
- AlamofireImage (for asynchronous image loading)

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the project in Xcode
3. Install necessary dependencies using Swift Package Manager
4. Set up a Parse Server on Back4App:
   - Create an account on [Back4App](https://www.back4app.com/)
   - Create a new app in the Back4App dashboard
   - Note your Parse API Address, Application ID, and Client Key
5. In the `AppDelegate.swift` file, initialize Parse with your Back4App credentials:

```swift
ParseSwift.initialize(applicationId: "YOUR_APPLICATION_ID",
                      clientKey: "YOUR_CLIENT_KEY",
                      serverURL: URL(string: "YOUR_SERVER_URL")!)
```

6. Build and run the app on your iOS device or simulator

## Usage

1. Launch the app
2. Sign up for a new account or log in with existing credentials
3. Tap the "+" button to create a new post
4. Select a photo from your photo library
5. Add a caption and post
6. View and interact with posts in your feed
